Which jobs are most crucial?
  Ultimately, the game is an RPG, so the most crucial part would have to be the battle system. 
  Without a battle system ,adventure is pointless! 
  The story is a very minor part of this project and should be held off until the very end. 
  To make sure this process goes smoothly, developing UML Diagrams are key so we are organized from the start. 
  
Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
  As mentioned before, the battle system acts as the core of our project.
  However, the world setting and map is also very important as it will give us an "area" to find battles.
  The battle should still act as the core however, as we can make the map into something very basic to the point where it's not much of a feature at all.
  
Which components are prerequisites for others?
  For the map, we must make the tile classes first. 
  Also, for the visuals, we must make/download different PNGs so we have the eye-appeal.
  The battle system must also be set in stone before we create enemies.
  
Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
  The making of the battle system MUST be done collaboratively. 
  The tile making can be delegated to one person as it is simply eye-candy and not much else.
  The making of the enemies, tile fuctionality, and player functionality can technically be delegated to one person, but the result will be better with a collaborative effort.
