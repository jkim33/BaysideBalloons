Plan: 2018-06-06

GENERAL ORDER:
- Implement a Test Battle system. 
- Add visuals for the battle. 
- Find PNGs/Tiles.
- Use the Test files as a backbone in the creation of the actual game.
- Expand, expand, expand. 

Which jobs are most crucial?
- Now it is important that we put the finishing touches of the battle system.
- We also need to implement the use of text on the screen so that we can have a nice user interface. 
- We must also implement the use of delay.

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
- The battle system needs to be finished so we have a game.
- With that, we need to find a way to organize the text and have appropriate stops and pauses.
- This will allow the user to understand what is happening.

Which components are prerequisites for others?
- Enemy class is essential to finish the battle system.
- We also need to finish some mathematics to see how the battle system will work and be implemented.
- Once we figure out a balanced system, we can actually implement the battle system.

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
- The mathematics of the battle system needs be done collaboratively. 
- Once we both have a grasp of the system, we can individually make multiple enemies.
- One of us can also get tiles and PNGs and do the general design.
