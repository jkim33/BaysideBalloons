Plan: 2018-06-04

GENERAL ORDER:
- Finish a Test Enemy class.
- Implement a Test Battle system.
- Make portal tiles and multiple maps.
- Try the Test Files.
- Find PNGs/Tiles.
- Use the Test files as a backbone in the creation of the actual game.
- Expand, expand, expand. 

Which jobs are most crucial?
- Currently, we have a good portion of the test files done.
- The wall and floor tiles have been implemented, and the player can move.
- We now must try and finish this test by implementing portal tiles, tha battle system and multiple maps.
- Once this test is finish, we will have a clear guidline of how to run the full game.

Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
- Portal tiles are an absolute necessaity as multiple maps will be needed for the purposes of our project.
- Of course, the battle system is important as it's the main game aspect of the game.

Which components are prerequisites for others?
- Portal tiles and enemy classes are needed ASAP.

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
- One person can make the enemy classes while the other makes or finds the tiles/PNGs we need.
- From there, we can collaborate on using the enemy classes to design the battle system well.
- We can also use the PNGs to collaboratively design different maps.
