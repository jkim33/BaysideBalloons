## 4 Years At Stuy : Mini-RPG

## Description
  This is a Mini-RPG that is meant to resemble a student's 4 years at Stuyvesant. You will venture through the halls to defeat the obstacles of Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior and Senior Year. As you venture to overcome these challenges, there will be enemies along the way that you will fight. At the end of each year, there is a boss to defeat. Once you defeat the boss, you gain an upgrade in every stat.
  Freshmen Year, you are out to defeat the librarian. Your mission is to search for the library and once you do, walk until you encounter the library itself. Sophomore Year, you search for you coach to defeat him! Try and find where the swimming pools are. Junior Year, you are tackling the most difficult challenge yet, the SATs! Stuy decided to administer the test in the cafeteria. Defeat it and save many from suffering. Finally, in Senior Year, you have senioritis. This causes you to go out on an adventure to defeat the one thing standing in between you and college - Your Teacher. You can find your specific teacher in a classroom.
