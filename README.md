## 4 Years At Stuy : Mini-RPG

## Description
  This is a Mini-RPG that is meant to resemble a student's 4 years at Stuyvesant. You will venture through the halls to defeat the obstacles of Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior and Senior Year. As you venture to overcome these challenges, there will be enemies along the way that you will fight. You have Magic and Normal Attacks to defeat these enemies and challenges.
  
## How it Works
  The RPG works by utilizing a number of classes. The basic player class contains all the stats as instance variables and this class has the methods that allows it to attack the enemies. Test (name is going to change), which has setup() and draw(), also has a keyPressed() which allows the user to move their character around the screen. Battles are encountered through a random number generator and you can only attack through the letter L (which is also subject to change).
